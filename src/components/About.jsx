                            I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer with 2+ years of experience crafting dynamic
                            and responsive web applications using JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, and modern frontend
                            frameworks like React. I love bridging the gap between design and technology,
                            ensuring that the products I build are not only functional but also visually engaging.
                            I've collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver scalable solutions, ranging from 
                            healthcare dashboards to intake form apps that streamline patient data. Currently, Iâ€™m focused on
                            enhancing my frontend expertise and exploring animation and UI micro-interactions that elevate
                            user experience. I'm a firm believer in clean code, continuous learning, and building for impact.
